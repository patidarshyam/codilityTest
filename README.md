#MaximumNumberOfAdditionLetterRequired 
 * You are given a string S consisting of letters 'a' and/or 'b'. A block is a
 * consecutive fragment of S composed of the same letters and surrounded by
 * different letters or string endings. For example, S = "abbabbaaa" has five
 * blocks: "a", "bb", "a", "bb" and "aaa". NI function solution(s); that, given
 * a string S of length N, returns the minimum number of additional letters
 * needed to obtain a string containing blocks of equal lengths. Examples: 1.
 * Given S = "babaa", the function should return 3. There are four blocks: "b",
 * "a", "b", "aa". One letter each should be added to the first, second and
 * third blocks, therefore obtaining a string "bbaabbaa", in which every block
 * is of equal length. 2. Given S="bbbab", the function should return 4. Two
 * letters each should be added to the second and third blocks, therefore
 * obtaining a string "bbbaaabbb", in which every block is of equal length. 3.
 * Given S = "bbbaaabbb", the function should return 0. All blocks are already
 * of equal lengths. Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * Test Output • Nis an integer within the range [1..40,000); • string S
 * consists only of the characters "a" and/or "b". 

# BinaryGap 
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.
For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
Write a function:
int solution(int N);
that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).

# CyclicRotation
A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.

For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]. The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right by K indexes.

Write a function:

Results solution(int A[], int N, int K);

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

For example, given array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] and K = 3, the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8].

Assume that:

N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.

# OddOccurencesInArray
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.
Write a function:

int solution(int A[], int N);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.

Assume that:

N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.

#Distinct
 Write a function
    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

Assume that:
        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
    A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
    A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.
Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.

# MaxProductOfThree
 A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).

For example, array A such that:

  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6

contains the following example triplets:

        (0, 1, 2), product is −3 * 1 * 2 = −6
        (1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
        (2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60

Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

Write a function:

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6

the function should return 60, as the product of triplet (2, 4, 5) is maximal.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));

# NumberOfDiscIntersections
We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. A zero-indexed array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).

The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:

  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 5
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 4
  A[5] = 0

<img src='disc.png' />

There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:

        discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
        disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.

Write a function:

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

Given array A shown above, the function should return 11, as explained above.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

# Triangle
A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 ≤ P < Q < R < N and:

        A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
        A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
        A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].

For example, consider array A such that:

  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20

Triplet (0, 2, 4) is triangular.

Write a function:

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns 1 if there exists a triangular triplet for this array and returns 0 otherwise.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20

the function should return 1, as explained above. Given array A such that:

  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 50    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1

the function should return 0.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));

# FrogJump
A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function:

def solution(X, Y, D)

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:

  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30
the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
Assume that:

X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
X ≤ Y.
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).

# PermMissingElem
A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
the elements of A are all distinct;
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
